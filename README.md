# CNN-CIFAR10-custom-evaluation
ðŸš€ Personal **Computer Vision Project** using **PyTorch** to train **CNNs** on **CIFAR-10** for object classification. I experiment with different architectures to optimize accuracy and evaluate the best model on custom images to assess real-world generalization.

To view the code, run CNN_CIFAR10_Custom_Evaluation.ipynb and ensure all required folders are saved.
