# CNN-Based Object Classification: CIFAR-10 & Custom Images
üöÄ This is my personal **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning** project using **PyTorch** to train custom **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** on **CIFAR-10** for object classification. I experiment with different architectures to optimize accuracy and evaluate the best model on **real photos taken with my phone** to assess real-world generalization.

üîç To view the code, run [CNN_CIFAR10_Custom_Evaluation.ipynb](https://github.com/Ksenia-Rydannykh/CNN-CIFAR10-custom-evaluation/blob/main/CNN_CIFAR10_Custom_Evaluation.ipynb) and ensure all required folders are saved.
